# De Viaje - Mobile App

## What this app does?
In De Viaje users can share bus schedules all across the country, after an schedule is created
and shared, other users can vote to let the community know if the posted schedule is helpful
or inaccurate, this will prevent people from posting inaccurate information as their schedules
will be down voted.

## Why?
There is little to no information about Nicaraguan bus schedules on the internet, therefor,
is better to have a place where all this information can be gathered and readily available,
the staff can't just go to every bus station out there, is better to have the community get and
post this information, is faster and easier for everyone.
